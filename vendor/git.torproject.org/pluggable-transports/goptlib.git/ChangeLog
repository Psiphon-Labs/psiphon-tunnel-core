== 0.5

The AcceptSocks function no longer reports non-permanent errors, such as
those caused by a faulty SOCKS handshake.

functions are ProxyError and ProxyDone. The ClientInfo struct has a new
ProxyURL member.

== 0.4

Read the ExtORPort cookie file on every call to DialOr, instead of
reading it once and caching the result. This is to work around a tor bug
where tor doesn't ensure a new cookie file is written before starting
pluggable transports.
https://bugs.torproject.org/15240

== 0.3

Made output functions panic intead of backslash-escaping. Escaping of

with the specified escaping of SMETHOD ARGS.
