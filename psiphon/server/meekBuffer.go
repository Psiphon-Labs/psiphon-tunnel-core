// CachedResponse is a data structure that supports meek
// protocol connection interruption resiliency: it stores
// payload data from the most recent response so that it
// may be resent if the client fails to receive it.
//
// The meek server maintains one CachedResponse for each
// meek client. Psiphon's variant of meek streams response
// data, so responses are not fixed size. To limit the memory
// overhead of response caching, each CachedResponse has a
// fixed-size buffer that operates as a ring buffer,
// discarding older response bytes when the buffer fills.
// A CachedResponse that has discarded data may still satisfy
// a client retry where the client has already received part
// of the response payload.
//
// A CachedResponse will also extend its capacity by
// borrowing buffers from a CachedResponseBufferPool, if
// available. When Reset is called, borrowed buffers are
// released back to the pool.
