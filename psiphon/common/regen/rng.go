/*
The default Source implementation is very slow to seed. Replaced with a
64-bit xor-shift source from http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/xorshift.pdf.
This source seeds very quickly, and only uses a single variable, so concurrent
modification by multiple goroutines is possible.

To create a seeded source:

	randSource := xorShift64Source(mySeed)

To create a source with the default seed:

	var randSource xorShift64Source
*/
type xorShift64Source uint64

func (src *xorShift64Source) Seed(seed int64) {
	*src = xorShift64Source(seed)
}

func (src *xorShift64Source) Int63() int64 {
	// A zero seed will only generate zeros.
	if *src == 0 {
		*src = 1
	}

	*src ^= *src >> 12 // a
	*src ^= *src << 25 // b
	*src ^= *src >> 27 // c

	return int64((*src * 2685821657736338717) >> 1)
