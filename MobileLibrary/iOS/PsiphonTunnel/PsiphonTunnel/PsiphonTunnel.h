 Required fields:
 - `PropagationChannelId`
 - `SponsorId`
 - Remote server list functionality is not strictly required, but absence greatly undermines circumvention ability.
   - `RemoteServerListURLs`
   - `RemoteServerListSignaturePublicKey`
 - Obfuscated server list functionality is also not strictly required, but aids circumvention ability.
   - `ObfuscatedServerListRootURLs`
   - `RemoteServerListSignaturePublicKey`: This is the same field as above. It is required if either `RemoteServerListURLs` or `ObfuscatedServerListRootURLs` is supplied.

 Optional fields (if you don't need them, don't set them):
 - `DataStoreDirectory`: If not set, the library will use a sane location. Override if the client wants to restrict where operational data is kept. If overridden, the directory must already exist and be writable.
 - `RemoteServerListDownloadFilename`: If not set, the library will use a sane location. Override if the client wants to restrict where operational data is kept.
 - `ObfuscatedServerListDownloadDirectory`: If not set, the library will use a sane location. Override if the client wants to restrict where operational data is kept. If overridden, the directory must already exist and be writable.
 - `UpstreamProxyUrl`
 - `EmitDiagnosticNotices`
 - `EgressRegion`
 - `EstablishTunnelTimeoutSeconds`
 - Only set if disabling timeouts (for very slow network connections):
   - `TunnelConnectTimeoutSeconds`
   - `TunnelPortForwardDialTimeoutSeconds`
   - `TunnelSshKeepAliveProbeTimeoutSeconds`
   - `TunnelSshKeepAlivePeriodicTimeoutSeconds`
   - `FetchRemoteServerListTimeoutSeconds`
   - `PsiphonApiServerTimeoutSeconds`
